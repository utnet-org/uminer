# Uminer

## bm_chip 
### it is developed on c++ driven by sophon chip driver, provided by sophon tech. Burning EFUSE, generation of key pairs, signature of chip are all executed at this module
1. install bm driver from sophon website, link is https://developer.sophon.ai/site/index/material/23/all.html, follow instructions to install driver at server. \
  you start with the command: "bm-smi" to check the status and information of all chips, shown below\
![Image Description](bm-smi.png)
2. for more details about installing the driver, there is  a separate readme file under ./src/README.md .

3. compile the libraries under the src/ directory:
   * g++ -shared -o libchip.so *.cpp ../bmlib/src/*.cpp ../bmlib/src/linux/*.cpp ../common/bm1684/src/common.c -I../bmlib/include -I../bmlib/src/linux -I../common/bm1684/include -I../config -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -lssl -lcrypto -fPIC
   * make sure cmake, openssl is all installed at the server
   * This will build a libchip.so at the same directoryï¼Œproviding sdk for golang to request
4. make a copy of libchip.so at local lib :
   * cp ./libchip.so /usr/local/lib/ (or cp ./libchip.so /usr/lib/)


## uminer_server
### it is the server developed on golang to provide grpc and http service, asked by miner app, communicating with utility nodes, base server or container cloud server
1. demo of bm-chip sdk request by golang
  * run the chip demo at /cmd/demo, this the demo to show how to burn, generate keys, sign message and verify signature: go build -o ../test, and do next: \
  ../test start dev_id : start the cpu of the chip, whose id number is dev_id. dev_id is the Bus-ID, like 1, 2, 3, 4 shown in the figure above (if it is not started, the following command will fail)\
  ../test burn dev_id : burn an AES key of the chip, whose id number is dev_id, at the efuse area, it will give a success message (this command can only be executed once, you are required to restart the server before proceeding the following command)\
  ../test keygen dev_id : generate p2 and pubkey from the efuse area, stored as two files (this command can only be executed once, the files are kept /bm_chip/src/key)\
  ../test keyread dev_id : read p2 and pubkey from stored files (this command can be executed multiple times, the result can be upload to blockchain)\
  ../test sign dev_id : send p2 and a message into the chip to sign a digest(this command can be executed multiple times)\
  ../test verify dev_id : send signature, message and pubkey to verify its validity(this command can be executed multiple times)\
   (dev_id now is defaulted as 6 for sign and verify, you can keyread the chip 6 8 10)
2. json file
    json files are stored at at /cmd/jsonfile, with a separate readme file explaining the function of each json file. Simply they are used for calling utility nodes grpc method to upload chip information, claim chip computation/stake or sign transaction.
