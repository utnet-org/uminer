# Uminer - Contribution Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Uminer! This document outlines the processes and guidelines for contributing to our open source blockchain project. Our goal is to create a transparent, efficient, and collaborative environment for all contributors.

## Pull Requests

### Creating Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: For each new feature or fix, create a new branch from the `main` branch.
3. **Commit Changes**: Make your changes in your branch. Commit messages should be clear and follow best practices.
4. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. **Open a Pull Request**: From your forked repository, open a pull request to the main project. The PR title should clearly state the purpose, and the description should provide all necessary information, including any references to issues being addressed.

### Review Process

1. **Code Review**: Maintainers will review the code. Reviewers may request changes.
2. **Testing**: Ensure that your code passes all existing tests and, if applicable, write new tests.
3. **Discussion**: Be responsive to feedback and questions from the project maintainers.
4. **Approval**: Once approved by a maintainer, the PR will be merged into the main branch.

## Merging

1. **Maintainers Only**: Only project maintainers can merge PRs.
2. **Merge Strategy**: We use a squash merge strategy to keep the history clean and manageable.
3. **Post-Merge**: After merging, the contributor's branch can be deleted to keep the repository tidy.

## Coding Guidelines

1. **Follow `go-utility` Coding Conventions**:
   - **Code Style**: Adhere to the coding style used in the `go-utility` project. This includes [effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) coding standards and additional project-specific conventions.
   - **Formatting**: Use tools like `gofmt` or `goimports` to format your code according to Go standards. This ensures consistency across the codebase.
   - **Commenting and Documentation**: Follow the commenting style of `go-utility`. This means writing clear, concise comments that explain non-obvious features or implementations. Additionally, update or add documentation reflecting the purpose and use of your contributions.
   - **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful and descriptive names, following the naming conventions in `go-utility`. For instance, use `MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` rather than underscores to write multiword names.
   - **Error Handling**: Follow Go's conventional error handling patterns as demonstrated in `go-utility`. Check for errors where necessary and handle them appropriately.
   - **Tests**: Write tests for your code following `go-utility`'s testing patterns. Ensure that your code passes all existing tests and that your new tests sufficiently cover any new functionality.

2. **Code Review Process**:
   - Your code submissions will be reviewed according to the `go-utility` review process. Familiarize yourself with this process to understand how your contributions will be evaluated.

3. **Referencing `go-utility` Code**:
   - If your contribution is closely related to existing `go-utility` code, reference the relevant files or sections in your pull request description.

4. **Documentation**: 
    - Document your code where necessary. Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.

5. **Testing**:
    - Write tests for new features or bug fixes.

Remember, consistency with the existing codebase is crucial. When in doubt, refer to the `go-utility` repository for guidance on style and best practices.

## Distribution

1. **Versioning**: We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Increment version numbers based on the scope of the change.
2. **Releases**: Regular releases are scheduled by the maintainers. Contributors will be informed about upcoming releases.

## General Guidelines

1. **Issues**: Use the GitHub issue tracker for bugs, feature requests, or discussions.
2. **Communication**: For real-time communication, we use [Slack/Discord/Other platforms]. Please keep the discussion professional and respectful.
